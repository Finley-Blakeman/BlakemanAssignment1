# Things I learned from "Interactive Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with WebGL:

# 1) Graphics Processing Units have evolved to be as complex if not move complex than CPUs and are so powerful that they can be used as mini supercomputers.

# 2) In the early years of special-purpose graphics systems, the process of reloading the screen would easily overpower the computer so it was necessary to create a display processor. These processors held the memory of the display list/file that would be repetively executed to cut down on the computing of the main computer.


# What I changed about the triangle:

# 1) The triangle color gradient is now yellow, white, and orange.

# 2) The triangle vertices have been changed slightly to make a larger triangle that is in a different position on the graphics canvas.
